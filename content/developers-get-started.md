# One-time Environment setup

NOTE: Already have both Nix and direnv? Head to the [Reproducible project list](/reproducible-project-list) to find a project to contribute to!

The only way to keep open source software development fun is to have a rock-solid way to drop in and out of projects as quickly and seamlessly as possible.

But most importantly... a way that won't break or is fully reproducible.

That's what [Nix]() provides both technologically and by convention. See [Why Nix Flakes guarantee a more seamless developer experience]() for more information.

## Download Nix

https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-linux

## Setup your shell or editor integration with direnv

This allows you to skip running `nix develop` before developing a new repository and make the experience of dropping into a new project nicer.
